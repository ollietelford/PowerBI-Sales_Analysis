# Power BI - Sales Analysis
Part of the Data Bootcamp was learning Power BI, and for this I used an interactive course for the PL-300 exam from Skillable which focused on:
- ðŸ”Ž Managing the ETL process: retrieving data from multiple sources, Power Query
- ðŸ“– Prepared for dashboard building: created hierarchies and folders, managed cardinalities, changed data formatting and category
- ðŸ”¡ DAX
- ðŸ“Š Creating interactive and informative dashboards

## Managing the ETL Process
I retrieved data from SQL Servers, CSV files as well as other sources and used Power Query to transform the data prior to loading. Some of the things I used Power Query for were:
- Adding, merging, splitting and removing columns (by example, custom, custom function, delimiter)
- Removing duplicates and ensuring of primary key
- Managing nested queries
- Filtering, sorting, grouping and aggregating
- Merged and appending queries
- Pivoted and unpivoted columns
- Extracting substrings and date & time information
-----
## Prepared for Dashboard Building
- Created folders for easier navigation
- Created hierarchies to allow for drill-through options in visuals
- Managed cardinalities, ensuring one-to-many or one-to-one where ever possible and creating new queries if needed to maintain these relationships
- Changed data formatting, e.g. string, number of decimal places
- Changed data category to appropriate location setting for map visuals
- Grouped data into 'other' category
- DAX:

## Created Interactive Dashboards
Used visuals to create interactive dashboards to display relevant information to tell stories with data and graphs concisely.
- User operated filters
- All preloaded visuals 
- Change formatting: font, colour, axis, title
